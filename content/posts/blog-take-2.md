Two years have flown by and I haven't been active on here at all. Hopefully that changes this year. I think my problem has been sitting on material, thinking that every post has to be a gem.

We can't all be wordsmiths.

What this place should be is a dumping ground for my thoughts - well sculpted or otherwise. So look forward to just that - brewing, programming, traveling - I don't want to pin this place down to any single facet just yet.
