Fizzbuzz is an (in?)famous programming interview question whose description is actually fairly straightforward:

> For each number from N=1 to N=100, if N is&hellip;
>
> * ...disible by 3, output "Fizz".
> * ...divisible by 5, output "Buzz".
> * ...divisible by both 3 and 5, output "FizzBuzz".
> * ...otherwise, output the number itself.

A straighforward problem often leads to a straighforward solution - but of course, we're not straightforward. That'd be too simple, that'd be – __boring__.

We'll require numbers to do this, but we're no freeloaders. Over here we serve our own hand-crafted artisinal numbers.

Let's go ahead and do just that.
Add a few helpful aliases:

It's a __long__ ways to 100 down this route, so let's forge another path.
